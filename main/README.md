There is a new file here called parsing.py, which is a modified version of your file.

Run router.py with Python3.
There is no GUI. There is a small menu in the terminal itself.
When you select 'fetch', it creates a file for that macaddr, and writes all the parsed messages in
it, along with a file called mac_address.txt, which will contain a list of all the mac_addr
ever associated.
When fetch is called, it will print file by file for all the mac addresses.
There will be another option that will display a list of mac addr, and the user can select
which mac address to show the parsed errors for.
This is incomplete. Still working on it. But you can check it out.

A sample of the files that will be created is there in the folder.
